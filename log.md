# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 30, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Leared about conda environments and about managing Python packages. Learned about [Python repo structure](https://kenreitz.org/essays/repository-structure-and-python).

**Thoughts:** Conda is new to me, however it seems like the better option for pkg management for Python and other languages in my radar like R.
